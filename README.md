## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

1. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`)

## How the Filters Work

The filters are designed to be context-aware:

1. **Normal Order**: Select filters from top to bottom (Development ‚Üí Community ‚Üí Sub Community ‚Üí etc.)
2. **Out of Order**: If you select a filter out of order (e.g., Sub Community first), the previous filters will automatically adjust to show only valid options
3. **Auto-Selection**: If there's only one valid option for a previous filter, it will be auto-selected
4. **Reset**: Filters after the selected one are reset to "All"
